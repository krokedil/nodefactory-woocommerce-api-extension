== Frequently Asked Questions ==
**Does this plugin automatically add the PSP's transaction number to the WooCommerce API view order endpoint?**
To be able to send the *transaction number* from the payment service provider to [Sharespine] (https://www.sharespine.com/) & [Plugboard] (http://plugboard.io/) (in a view order API request - https://woothemes.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/#view-an-order), the transaction number needs to be stored in the order as a Post Meta field with the name *_transaction_id*. 

This can be accomplished by a payment module when the order status of an order in WooCommerce is set to *Processing* (upon payment of the order) like this: 

```$order->payment_complete( $psp_transaction_number );```

**Are there any payment gateways that support this already?**
The following payment gateways are supported and doesn't need any modification or updates.
- [WooCommerce Klarna Gateway] (https://www.woothemes.com/products/klarna/) (v2.0+)
